## Introduction

This project focuses on tracking individual student performance while also providing Learning Management System (LMS) functionalities. Below is a more detailed explanation of the ranking system and how it encourages student participation and engagement.

•	Track and analyze students’ academic progress by monitoring their grades, attendance, assignments, and course activities.
•	Provide LMS features, such as course management, assignment submission, notifications, and student collaboration.

Academic setbacks, such as poor performance, missed deadlines, and falling behind in coursework, can severely impact a student’s academic journey. This student performance tracking system, integrated with LMS functionalities, plays a crucial role in mitigating academic losses and ensuring students stay on track toward success.
