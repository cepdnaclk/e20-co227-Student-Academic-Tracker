## Introduction

This project focuses on tracking individual student performance while also providing Learning Management System (LMS) functionalities. Below is a more detailed explanation of the ranking system and how it encourages student participation and engagement.

•	Track and analyze students’ academic progress by monitoring their grades, attendance, assignments, and course activities.

•	Provide LMS features, such as course management, assignment submission, notifications, and student collaboration.

Academic setbacks, such as poor performance, missed deadlines, and falling behind in coursework, can severely impact a student’s academic journey. This student performance tracking system, integrated with LMS functionalities, plays a crucial role in mitigating academic losses and ensuring students stay on track toward success.


## Other Sub Topics


Using this system you can obtain,

1. Student Performance Tracking

This system is designed to provide detailed insights into students' academic performance. By tracking grades, assignments, and course activities, it enables educators to identify struggling students and offer timely support. The tracking system ensures that students receive the attention they need to improve their performance and stay motivated throughout the course.

2. Course Management

Administrators and instructors can efficiently manage courses through the system. From uploading course materials, such as lecture notes, to monitoring assignments and grades, course management is streamlined. The system supports easy updates and maintenance, allowing instructors to focus on teaching and engaging students.

3. Assignment and Quiz Submission

Students can submit assignments and quizzes directly through the system, ensuring that all submissions are efficiently tracked and graded. This digital submission process minimizes the risk of lost or misfiled work, providing a clear record of all academic submissions and grades.

4. Real- time Notifications

The system includes a notification feature that alerts students about important updates, such as new assignments, course material uploads, upcoming deadlines, and grade postings. These notifications keep students informed and help them stay on top of their academic responsibilities.

5. Event Management
Both students and administrators can utilize the integrated event calendar for scheduling and managing academic events, deadlines, and
meetings. This ensures that everyone stays aware of upcoming important dates and activities, reducing the chance of missed deadlines or conflicts.

6. Security and User Authentication

The system employs token-based authentication to ensure secure access to student and course data. By validating user credentials and securely storing tokens, the platform ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive academic information. This feature maintains the integrity and privacy of the system.


7. GPA-based Ranking System

The GPA-based ranking system provides a transparent view of student performance, offering a ranking of students based on their academic standing. This encourages healthy competition and motivates students to improve their performance, while also giving instructors a tool to track overall class progress.

8. Attendance tracking

The students attendance system allows lecturers to mark attendance of the students and students to view their attendance for each course enabaling active participation of students throuthout the course.
